# Filtering Arrays within a where clause

Sometimes certain cols store data in arrays like so:

```txt
"{17486868,19127222,16325112,17624312}"
{16325112}
```

There are times I would need to search througth arrays like I would use `like`. This can be done with the following here I am using Trino syntax.a

```sql
select * from some.table
where contains(col, '<search-term>')
```

Below are some other ways to achieve the same depending on your database.

## ðŸ”¹ General SQL engines

- **PostgreSQL**

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM my_table
  WHERE 17487010 = ANY(my_array_column);
  ```

- **BigQuery**

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM my_table
  WHERE 17487010 IN UNNEST(my_array_column);
  ```

- **Snowflake** (arrays are VARIANTs)

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM my_table
  WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(17487010, my_array_column);
  ```
