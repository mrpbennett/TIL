# Postgres naming convention

The most common naming convention for PostgreSQL is to use `snake_case` for
object names, which means that the words in the name are separated by
underscores. For example, a table name might be user_accounts or a column name
might be first_name.

Here are some naming conventions commonly used in PostgreSQL:

Table names: Use a plural noun or a noun phrase to name tables. For example,
`users`, `orders`, or `customer_accounts`.

Column names: Use a singular noun or a noun phrase to name columns. For example,
`id`, `first_name`, or `order_date`.

Primary keys: Name primary key columns id or `<table_name>_id`, where
`<table_name>` is the name of the table. For example, a primary key column for a
table named `users` might be named `id` or `user_id`.

Foreign keys: Name foreign key columns `<referenced_table>_id` or
`<table_name>_id`, where `<referenced_table>` is the name of the table being
referenced. For example, a foreign key column in a table named orders that
references a table named customers might be named `customer_id` or
`customers_id`.

Constraints: Name constraints using a prefix that indicates the type of
constraint, followed by a brief description of the constraint. For example, a
unique constraint on a column named `email` might be named `uq_users_email`.

**Remember, naming conventions are not set in stone, and you should choose the
convention that works best for your project and team. The most important thing
is to be consistent with your naming throughout your database schema.**
