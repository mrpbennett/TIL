# What is `SERIAL` in SQL?

In SQL, `SERIAL` is a datatype that is often used to create auto-incrementing
integer columns, typically for primary key columns. It's commonly used in
PostgreSQL, but its functionality might have variations in other database
systems.

When you define a column with the `SERIAL` datatype as the primary key, the
database system automatically generates a unique value for that column whenever
a new row is inserted into the table. This value starts from 1 and increments by
1 for each new row. This is very useful for creating primary keys, as it ensures
that each row in the table has a distinct and automatically assigned identifier.

Here's an example of how you might use `SERIAL` to create a primary key in
PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    -- Other columns
);
```

In this example, the id column will be the primary key, and its values will be
automatically generated by the database system.

It's important to note that while `SERIAL` is a convenient way to create
auto-incrementing primary keys, it's not a standard SQL datatype and might not
be supported in all database systems. In some other databases, you might use
different approaches, such as `AUTO_INCREMENT` in MySQL or `IDENTITY` in
Microsoft SQL Server, to achieve the same functionality. Always consult the
documentation of your specific database system for the appropriate syntax and
options.
