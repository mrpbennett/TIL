# Increment a cell every month

To increment a cell by 1 in Excel every month, you can use a combination of
formulas and features such as Excel's DATE and TODAY functions. Here's a
step-by-step guide to achieve this:

**Set Up Your Worksheet:**

- In an empty cell, enter the initial value. Let's assume you want to start with
  1, so you can enter "1" in cell A1.

- In another cell, enter the starting date. For example, enter the first day of
  the month in cell B1, like "01/01/2023" for January 2023.

**Increment the Value:** In the cell where you want to display the incremented
value each month (e.g., cell A2), enter the following formula:

```excel
=A1 + IF(MONTH(TODAY()) > MONTH(B1), 1, 0)
```

This formula adds 1 to the value in cell A1 if the current month (determined by
TODAY()) is greater than the month in cell B1 (the starting month). It
effectively increments the value at the beginning of each new month.

**Set Up Automatic Updates:**

- By default, Excel will not update the formula until you manually recalculate
  it. To have it automatically update every month, you can enable automatic
  calculation.
- Go to the "Formulas" tab in Excel.
- In the "Calculation Options" group, select "Automatic."

With this setup, the value in cell A2 will automatically increment by 1 at the
beginning of each new month. Just make sure to update the starting date in cell
B1 whenever you want the increment to start from a different month.
