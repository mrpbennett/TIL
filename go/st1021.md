# The ST1021 warning...

Go uses **godoc** for generating documentation, and it follows a specific convention for documenting types, methods, and functions.

The **ST1021** error encountered isn't specific to Go, but the idea of documenting an exported type in Go follows a similar structure. In Go, an **exported type** is one that begins with an uppercase letter, making it accessible outside the package.

### Go Documentation Comments

In Go, documentation comments should start with the name of the type, function, or method you're documenting. This makes it clear what you're documenting and ensures consistency.

### Example of Go Code with Documentation Comment (Correct Style):

#### Struct Example:

```go
package main

// Person represents an individual with a name and age.
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

In this example, the documentation comment for the `Person` struct starts with **"Person"**, the name of the type. This helps anyone reading the code to understand immediately what type is being described.

#### Method Example:

```go
package main

// Greet prints a greeting for the person.
func (p *Person) Greet() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old.\n", p.Name, p.Age)
}
```

Here, the comment for the `Greet` method starts with **"Greet"** (the name of the function), followed by a brief description of what the method does.

### Common Go Documentation Style:

- **Start with the name of the type, function, or method.**
- **Use complete sentences** and be concise.
- **If the type has fields**, you can describe them as well in the documentation for the type.

### Corrected Go Example:

Let's say you had an incorrect comment in Go, and it was flagged by a linter or a tool. Here’s how you might correct it:

#### Incorrect Style:

```go
package main

// This struct represents a person with a name and age.
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

This is incorrect because the comment doesn’t start with the name of the type (`Person`).

#### Corrected Style:

```go
package main

// Person represents an individual with a name and age.
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

### Why It's Important:

- **Clarity:** When you're documenting types or functions, always starting with the name helps anyone scanning the code quickly identify what’s being described.
- **Consistency:** Follow this pattern throughout your Go code to maintain a uniform style and make it easier for others to understand your code.

### More Examples:

#### For a Type Alias:

```go
package main

// Point represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates.
type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}
```

#### For a Constructor Function:

```go
package main

// NewPerson creates a new Person with the given name and age.
func NewPerson(name string, age int) *Person {
    return &Person{Name: name, Age: age}
}
```

In summary, Go documentation comments should **start with the type or function name** and provide a brief description of what it does. It's a simple but powerful convention that makes your code easier to read and maintain.
