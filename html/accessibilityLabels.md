# Accessibility labels

Labels can be used to provide context for information. For example, if we have a primary and secondary navigation, we can use `arial-label` to distinguish between them.

```
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Primary">  
  <ul><li>...a list of links here ...</li></ul>
</div>  
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Secondary">  
  <ul><li>...a list of links here ...</li> </ul>
</div> 
```
