# What is a polyfill

A polyfill is a piece of additional code that is not built into a web browser. It helps developers implement a technology that we would expect a browser to have natively.

For example, if we use HTML5 features that are not supported on some versions of IE natively, they can still work on web pages if we install polyfills for these features.
