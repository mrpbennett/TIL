# Using a local environment variable

Using local variables are easy as 123, when using systems such as Netlify. I have placed this within JavaScript as this would be the same for Node and React.

`process.env.LOCAL_VARIABLE`

Once the above is in place, you will have to place the actual token / key within your build system.
