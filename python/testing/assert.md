# Assert in Python testing

The `assert` keyword is used to perform a runtime assertion check. It allows you
to test whether a certain condition is True, and if the condition is not met, an
AssertionError exception is raised, which can help you identify issues or bugs
in your code during development and testing.

The syntax of the `assert` statement is as follows:

```python
assert condition, message
```

Here, `condition` is the expression you want to check, and `message` is an
optional string that you can provide to give more context about the assertion
failure. The `condition` should evaluate to True for the code to continue
executing normally. If the `condition` is `False`, Python raises an
`AssertionError` with the provided `message` (or a default `message` if none is
given).

Here's an example of how you might use the assert statement:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Division by zero is not allowed"
    return a / b

result = divide(10, 0)
print(result)
```

In this example, the `assert` statement checks if b is not equal to zero before
performing the division. Since b is 0, the condition is `False`, and an
`AssertionError` is raised with the specified message: "Division by zero is not
allowed".
